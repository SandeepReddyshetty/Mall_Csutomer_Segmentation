# Mall_Customer_Segmentation

Understanding your customers is a crucial aspect of any business strategy. This project focuses on customer segmentation using machine learning techniques, specifically K-Means Clustering, to identify target customers who are more likely to engage with your marketing efforts.

## Problem Statement
Imagine you own a mall and want to optimize your marketing strategy. Your goal is to identify customer segments that are more likely to respond positively to marketing campaigns. This information can help you allocate resources effectively and tailor your marketing efforts to reach the right audience.

Objectives
This notebook aims to achieve the following objectives:

- Customer Segmentation: We will use the K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment your customer base into distinct groups. This will help you understand the different types of customers you have.

- Target Customer Identification: By clustering customers, we can identify the target customer groups that are more likely to be receptive to marketing strategies. This can lead to more efficient and effective marketing campaigns.

- Real-world Marketing Insights: We will explore how these segmentation insights can be applied in a real-world marketing context. Understanding your customers' preferences and behaviors can help you design marketing campaigns that resonate with them.
